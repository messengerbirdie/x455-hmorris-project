        <h2>Personal</h2>
        <img src="Images/About 2.jpg" alt="Doge">
        <p>Born and raised in Sacramento, Sally always had a passion for helping others, which led them to pursue a career in nursing. After completing nursing school, they dedicated several years to providing compassionate care in various healthcare settings. However, over time, Sally realized that their love for assisting people extended beyond just medical care. This led to a shift in their career, where they transitioned into the world of aesthetics.</p>
        <div class="expand-text">
          <p>With a deep desire to make a meaningful impact, they moved to the Sierras, a region known for its natural beauty but limited access to specialized beauty services. Here, Sally combined their medical background with their newfound love for skincare and wellness, offering personalized aesthetician services to a community that often struggled to find such care. With a commitment to enhancing both physical and mental well-being, Sally brings a holistic approach to every treatment, creating an environment where clients feel rejuvenated, relaxed, and truly cared for.
