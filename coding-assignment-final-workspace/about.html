              Born and raised in Sacramento, Sally always had a passion for
              helping others, which led them to pursue a career in nursing.
              After completing nursing school, they dedicated several years to
              providing compassionate care in various healthcare settings.
              However, over time, Sally realized that their love for assisting
              people extended beyond just medical care. This led to a shift in
              their career, where they transitioned into the world of
              aesthetics.

                With a deep desire to make a meaningful impact, they moved to
                the Sierras, a region known for its natural beauty but limited
                access to specialized beauty services. Here, Sally combined
                their medical background with their newfound love for skincare
                and wellness, offering personalized aesthetician services to a
                community that often struggled to find such care. With a
                commitment to enhancing both physical and mental well-being,
                Sally brings a holistic approach to every treatment, creating an
                environment where clients feel rejuvenated, relaxed, and truly
                cared for.

              Sally’s educational journey began at Greenfield High School in
              Sacramento, where she excelled in science and health courses,
              igniting her passion for caring for others. After graduation, she
              pursued a Bachelor of Science in Nursing at Riverstone University,
              a well-regarded school known for its hands-on approach to
              healthcare.

                At Sierra Valley, Sally learned advanced techniques in skincare,
                facials, and body treatments, blending her nursing knowledge
                with aesthetic practices. With both nursing and aesthetician
                certifications, she transitioned her career to offering
                specialized services in the Sierras, where her unique skill set
                is helping people feel both physically and emotionally
                rejuvenated.

            <p>
              While studying, she also completed volunteer work at local
              clinics, further strengthening her desire to help those in need.
              Upon earning her nursing degree, Sally worked as a registered
              nurse at Sacramento General Hospital for several years. However,
              her interest in holistic wellness led her to enroll in the Sierra
              Valley School of Aesthetics, where she completed an intensive
              program in medical aesthetics.
